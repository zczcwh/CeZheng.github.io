# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #

* I'm a first year Ph.D. student at Machine Vision Lab of University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) with [Prof. Chen Chen](https://webpages.uncc.edu/cchen62/). Before joining UNCC, I obtained my Master's degree in Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Tufts University in Aug 2019, advised by [Prof. Shuchin Aeron](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/~shuchin/). I received my Bachelor's Degree in Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Bridgeport in May 2016, advised by [Prof. Xingguo Xiong](https://www.bridgeport.edu/faculty/xingguo-michael-xiong). I also received my Bachelor's Degree in School of Information Science and Engineering at Wuhan University of Science and Technology in June 2016.
